            <p class="white center" id="meethilarycontent">Welcome to my shop! I'm Hilary Rose, loan specialist by day, designer and creator of Hilary's Hall of Art by night. 
I've always had a passion for crafting and love the process of creating unique, beautiful items.<br><br>

I grew up in Charlotte, NC and went to college at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. In college my friends and I would always look for new things to decorate our apartments with, but could never find exactly what we were looking for in the store. So I figured why not create it myself?! I started by making paintings and signs and branched out to designing t-shirts for different campus events. I sold my creations and saved up money to buy myself a craft printer- by far my favorite investment!<br><br>

When I'm not at work or designing, I enjoy all things related to being outdoors- hiking, biking, walking, you name it! My boyfriend Chris and I love exploring new areas and hope to move to the mountains one day! We have a crazy cat, Indie, named after our favorite genre of music. <br><br>

Feel free to contact me with any questions! I love getting to know my clients so that I can create personalized items for them!  I look forward to working with each and every one of you!  </p>

            <p class="white center">Below are the current items that I have finished and are still available. This section will be updated regularly. You will notice a variety of weird items. This is because I just create whatever comes to my mind. From shirts, to mugs, to weird pencil sketches, it will all be here. The products I make by request (See Product Request link) are not found here because they are made specifically and privately for people. These items will vary over time and so you don't see anything you like now, check back in the future! Lastly, if you are interested in any of them, I currently am not running purchases through this site. Hopefully that comes soon! Therefore, you should reach me via the Request Product section or any of the Social Media links at the bottom of the page. Thanks!  </p>

            <div class="column1"> <p class="white center" id="meethilarycontent">I met Hilary in Asheville and after only talking at the local brewery for a couple hours we planned to meet up to go to all the arts and crafts shops Asheville has to offer. We found so many cute items, but one really stood out to me. It was just a little simple jewelry box, but it was so expensive. I was pretty upset about that. Throughout the weekend Hilary and I exchanged information. About 2 weeks later a suprise came to my doorstep, and it was the jewelry box, only she made it! It looked just like it, and she said she made it for next to nothing. I couldn't believe how amazing of a person could know someone for a short few hours and yet do something so nice. We have been friends ever since! </p>
             </div>
             <div class="column2"> <p class="white center" id="meethilarycontent">I have been friends with Hilary since freshman year of college. Whenever we needed little items for our dorm rooms or apartments we always went to her. She would make things that were super useful for our desks or bathrooms, but she also made us all the fun cute stuff that was just there to brighten up our days. I think by the end of the four years most of our wardrobes and kitchen ware were things that she had made us! The best part about Hilary is that she does it all with love. You can tell she just wants to make you happy and feel good when she makes you something neat. I still have a ton of the things she made me, and I don't plan on ever getting rid of them.</p></div>
             <div class="column3"> <p class="white center" id="meethilarycontent">Hilary made me a bracelet with a message to keep me positive and motivated during a rough time. It was cute and so kind that I ended up wearing it without taking it off for a long time. It finally met the end of the road and it broke. I was surprised that I was actually quite devestated about it. Hilary being the person she is noticed immediately that day when I saw her that I was in a bit of a funk. I was kind of embarrassed but I told her I am just sad that the bracelet you made me broke. It was near exams and she was probably busy, but the very next day she had a new one of the exact same kind for me. It gave me the biggest smile, and I put it back on, and haven't taken it off. Hilary is amazing!</p> </div>
